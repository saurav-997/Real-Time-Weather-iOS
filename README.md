Hi This is my first Git repository

➤ This app tells the weather info of current location and its current time. user just need to open this app it will automatically fetch location and tells the user weather of their current location but for location user needs to give permission and it doesn't fetch location in background, moreover it just detect ur cuurent location stop fetching loction once it is fetched.

➤ The project's UI is simple and sober and it support both **light and dark mode**

➤ I have created this app by applying many functionalites like RestAPI and MVC pattern.

➤ For RestAPI i have used OpenWeather current weather data api (**openweathermap.org**)

➤ Moreover i have applied a basic animation (**UIView.animate()**) for a batter look.

Thanks
